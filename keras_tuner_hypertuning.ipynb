    "# HyperTuning with KerasTuner and TensorFlow\n",

    "\n",
    "Building machine learning models is an iterative process that involves optimizing the model's performance and compute resources. The settings that you adjust during each iteration are called *hyperparameters*. They govern the training process and are held constant during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of searching for optimal hyperparameters is called *hyperparameter tuning* or *hypertuning*, and is essential in any machine learning project. Hypertuning helps boost performance and reduces model complexity by removing unnecessary parameters (e.g., number of units in a dense layer).\n",
    "There are two type of hyperparameters:\n",
    "1. *Model hyperparameters* that influence model architecture (e.g., number and width of hidden layers in a DNN)\n",
    "2. *Algorithm hyperparameters* that influence the speed and quality of training (e.g., learning rate and activation function).\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of hyperparameter combinations, even in a shallow DNN, can grow insanely large making manually searching for the optimal set simply not feasible nor scalable. \n",
    "This post will introduce you to KerasTuner, a library made to automate the hyperparameter search. We'll build a deep learning model and train it on the Fashion MNIST dataset with:\n",
    "* Pre-selected hyperparameters\n",
    "* Optimized hyperparameters with KerasTuner\n",
    "* Optimized pre-trained Xception and ResNet models\n",
