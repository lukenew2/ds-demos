# Data Science Demos
## About
Repository containing data science concepts and ideas presented in jupyter notebooks, 
write-ups, and sometimes presentation slides.  

## Installation
Environments differ notebook to notebook.  At the beggining of each notebook, 
the package versions pertaining to the concept or idea are printed out for ease
of reproducibility.
